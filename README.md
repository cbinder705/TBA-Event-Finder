# Rutgers Bootcamp Project 1 Group #3- Event Finder "Find your Fun!"

## Description

We created a easy-to-use tool to help you enjoy your free time!

It’s a local event finder called “Find your Fun!”.  

First, select the type of event you want to enjoy, which can be sports, concerts or comedy shows.

Next, enter the city where you live or where you will be.  
Press the View Events button and Voila!  A map of the area and events in that location appear before your eyes!

You can even see a list of your previous event searches!


## USER STORY

As a user<br>
I WANT to view a website that shows local sports, concerts and comedy shows<br>
SO THAT I can attend an event during my free time<br>

## Technologies Used

We used the VS Code software to edit code, git and git branches to work on the code among our group and pull code to our local machines and then git again to push our final versions from our branches to the GitHub main branch.  

We also used Server-side APIs: Ticketmaster for events, XXXXX for XXX, CSS framework: Materialize, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, VS Code, Git/GitHub and persistent data/local storage to retrieve past event searches.  This website is responsive, including the background image.
